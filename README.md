# ProtoHaskell

My current personal project - a "toy" compiler for a haskell-like language. If I decide to go full-strength with it, it may eventually meet the Haskell 2010 standard.

I'm not trying to compete with GHC. Just have fun and learn. If this compiler could offer anything relatively simple that GHC doesn't (possibly because of conflicts with other parts of GHC-Haskell) feel free to suggest extensions in an issue.

Progress and some theory is being detailed [here](https://github.com/JKTKops/Write-You-a-Haskell-2) repository.

This is a stack project, so you can build it yourself with `stack build`. Currently there is no test suite because it is some mismatched parts. Once the parser is done, I'll include a test suite for it.
